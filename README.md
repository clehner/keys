# keys(1)

Simple key management tool for `.ssh/authorized_keys`,
intended for use with `git-shell(1)`.

## Usage

* **list**: list keys (with each line numbered)

	$ keys list
	ssh-rsa
	1. ssh-rsa ...
	...

* **add**: add keys (one per line)

	$ ./keys add <~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
	Added 1 keys

* **del**: delete keys (by line numbers)

	$ keys del 1
	Deleted 1 keys

## Installation

Copy the `keys` script into the `git-shell-commands` directory of your git
user's home directory, or clone the keys repo to that directory.

	cp keys ~git/git-shell-commands/

If you have the git user's shell set to `git-shell` so that they can only
manage git repos, putting `keys` in the `git-shell-commands` directory lets the
git user manage its ssh authorized keys as well. It could be used
non-interactively as follows:

	ssh git@example.org keys list
	ssh git@example.org keys add ...
	ssh git@example.org keys del ...
